This project will mainly make use of the OMNeT \cite{omnet} simulation tool. This program is a discrete event simulator based on modules described in C++. OMNeT allows for network modeling by independently defining each of the components - with their respective protocol stacks - and channels. In \cite{prime_replicability} the author shows an example of modeling PRIME technology with this tool. The main libraries used will be INET \cite{inet} and SimPRIME \cite{simprime}.

Matlab will be used to simulate the physical layer (PHY) and to obtain the characteristics of each communication channel. This method is similar to the one proposed in \cite{tesis_jmatanza}. To analyze the final results and plot graphics \textit{plotly} - an open-source Python library - will be used.
