# PLC-PRIME-Hybrid

The development of this simulation os part of a Bachelor's Thesis for the Telecommunications Engineering degree at Universidad Pontificia Comillas. 
The goal of this code is to accuratelly represent the communications between household electric meters and secondary substations (manned by the electric utility). 
This communication is currently mostly done via existing powerlines (PLC) and the inclusion of wireless (RF) technology is being considered. 


This PRIME-Hybrid project builds upon a PLC simulator constructed by Javier Matanza and incorporates the new additions regarding the wireless communication technology using standard 802.15.4.
